    "text": "The State of the Nation Address (SONA) delivered by the President of South Africa is a significant annual event. It serves as a platform for the nation’s leader to engage with citizens, government officials, and international observers. This address offers a pivotal opportunity for the President to assess the nation’s current state, articulate government priorities, and lay out policies and plans for the future. It represents a moment that encapsulates the nation’s aspirations in politics, society, and the economy.\nThe primary goal is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the speech content, aiming to detect evolving trends in sentiment and topics across time. This examination involves the application of sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques. Specifically, we will employ the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method for topic analysis. LDA is a widely adopted probabilistic model within the domains of machine learning and natural language processing. When LDA is harnessed for topic modeling, it excels at revealing concealed themes and patterns within extensive textual corpora. It achieves this by establishing connections between words and topics based on their co-occurrence tendencies. Meanwhile, sentiment analysis is focused on unveiling the emotional tone or “sentiment” conveyed within the text.\nThe SONA data used in this project comprises a total of 36 text files, each representing speeches delivered by six different presidents during the period from 1994 to 2023. The dataset includes 7 speeches from Nelson Mandela, 10 from Mbeki, 1 from Motlanthe, 1 from Ramaphosa, 10 from Zuma, and 1 from de Klerk. The analysis of sentiment and topics in the SONA data serves the purpose of uncovering the evolving subjects of discussion in speeches over time and the emotional tone expressed by each president while delivering their speeches."

    "text": "Sentiment analysis\nThe words are process further to extract sentiments or emotions that are associated with the words using sentiment lexicons. These lexicons enable users to classify words according to whether they express positive or negative sentiment. For this analysis, the tidytext package was utilized, which incorporates a collection of four pre-existing sentiment dictionaries. However for this research the dictionary used is bing, the lexicon lables words as either positive or negative. Table 1 shows that the word flawed is associated with a negative sentiment, while the word flexible is associated with a positive sentiment.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Example of the information stored in the bing dataset\n\n\nword\nsentiment\n\n\n\n\nflat-out\nnegative\n\n\nflawed\nnegative\n\n\nflees\nnegative\n\n\nflexible\npositive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sentiments linked to the words in our tibble were first attributed, and subsequently, the words underwent stemming. Table 2 indicates that, as per the Bing lexicon, the term “pride” elicits favorable emotions, while the term “dead” elicits unfavorable emotions.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Example of sentiment assigned to the words spoken at a SONA\n\n\nword\nsentiment\ndate\npresident\nID\n\n\n\n\npride\npositive\n1994-05-24\nMandela\n1\n\n\ndebt\nnegative\n1994-05-24\nMandela\n7\n\n\nwretch\nnegative\n1994-05-24\nMandela\n7\n\n\ndead\nnegative\n1994-05-24\nMandela\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring the common most positive and negative words used by the presidents\nFigure 1 shows that the leading negative word spoke at SONA is crime and the leading positive word spoken at SONA is improv, this is stemmed from the word improvement or improve\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Top 10 most common positive and negative words said by presidents during SONA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring the change in sentiment over time\nIn our analysis of the changes in sentiment over time, we observed (as seen in Figure 2) that the frequency of positive sentiment expressed in State of the Nation Addresses (SONAs) has remained relatively consistent over the years, from 1994 to 2009. However, there was a slight uptick in positive sentiments in 1994 May by 134 basis points. This is the period when Mandela addressed the nation post 1994 elections. A further uptick in positive sentiments was observed in 1995. This was a period marking a turning point in South African history, as they were the first democratic elections in the country. Nelson Mandela’s inauguration as President of South Africa was a momentous event, signifying the end of apartheid and the beginning of a new era of democracy. The positivity in his speech likely reflected the optimism and hope associated with this historic transition.\nConversely, the portrayal of negative sentiment, relative to the total words spoken, exhibited a distinct pattern. In the inaugural SONA of 1994, a notably elevated level of negative sentiment was evident. Subsequently, there was a substantial and consistent decline, spanning nearly two decades until 2015, marking a total decrease of negative sentiment by approximately 596 basis points, as seen in Figure 2. However, commencing from 2016, a notable reversal in this trend becomes apparent. This particular shift aligns with the conclusion of the Zuma era. During this period, the political and social landscape was evolving. This period was marked by political controversies, allegations of corruption, and challenges in governance. The Negative sentiment in SONAs during this time could reflect public concerns and criticisms related to these issues.\nNegative sentiments has remained on an upward trajectory since 2015. However, There’s been a slight increase in positive tone during SONA since 2018, an uptick of 539 basis point since 2017. This coincides with the Ramaphosa era. His presidency marked a transition to a new leadership characterized by promises of good governance, transparency, and a commitment to addressing the country’s challenges. These promises and a fresh start under new leadership would naturally generate positive sentiment.\nWhile positive sentiment in SONAsremains notably higher than during the Zuma era, hovering above 6%, there has been a marginal decrease in the optimistic tone in President Ramaphosa’s recent addresses. Several factors might contribute to this decline in positive sentiment as South Africa continues to grapple with significant problems such as unemployment. The ongoing existence of these challenges may contribute to a more tempered positive sentiment, corruption, an economic downturn and the on-going power outages. All these issues contribute to a dampened positive sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Analyzing the Shift in the Ratio of Positive and Negative Sentiment Frequencies Over the Years Relative to the Total Words Spoken during SONA"
